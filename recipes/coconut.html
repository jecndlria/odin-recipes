    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>⅓ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>12 ounces uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour and pepper in a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a second shallow dish. Stir together coconut and panko in a third shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, dredge shrimp in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip floured shrimp in egg; allow any excess to drip off. Finally, dredge in coconut mixture, pressing to adhere. Place shrimp on a plate. Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together honey, lime juice, and serrano chile in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle fried shrimp with cilantro and serve with honey-lime dip.</li>
